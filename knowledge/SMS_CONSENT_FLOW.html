        <p><strong>For use in Twilio A2P 10DLC registration:</strong></p>
        <p>This campaign sends compliance notifications and license expiration reminders to security guard employees. Messages include alerts about upcoming license expirations, renewal deadlines, and compliance status updates to help ensure employees maintain valid credentials required for their positions. All messages are sent only to employees who have explicitly opted in by texting START to our number, as disclosed during onboarding or through other communication channels.</p>
        
        <h2>End User Consent Description</h2>
        <p><strong>For use in Twilio A2P 10DLC registration:</strong></p>
        <p>Employees opt in to receive compliance notifications by initiating contact via SMS. During onboarding documentation, employees are informed that they can opt in to receive compliance notifications by texting our number with the keyword START. Employees may also discover the service through other company communications. Once an employee texts our number, they receive a welcome message explaining the service, message frequency, and how to opt out. Explicit consent is captured when the employee replies with START or JOIN. All messages include opt-out instructions (Reply STOP), and opt-out requests are honored immediately. Employees can re-enroll at any time by texting START again.</p>
